### Brand launch

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, CityLift marries a real estate developers perspective with engineering expertise to create automated space saving parking systems. A Splash/Full website was created for addressing space constraints within Oaklandâ€™s Hive neighborhood. The CityLift identity had already existed but the solutions were realtively unknown and unseen in the US. The combined knowledge of real estate developers, system engineers and land use professionals behind this product are presented through videos features in this informational site.
