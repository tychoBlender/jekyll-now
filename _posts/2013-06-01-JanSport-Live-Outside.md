### Live Outside 2013

JanSport has been making packs and outdoor gear since 1967. The JanSport brand has always been about the journey and the discovery of fun, freedom and adventure. Everyone everywhere can enjoy durable and versatile world-class packs – for life. JanSport’s Social Media presence is lively and inclusive across many different platforms. For this campaign YouTube, Facebook and Tumblr were synchronized to drive viewers to the weekly vignettes and episodes following a Band’s journey from San Francisco to Austin’s SXSW festival.
